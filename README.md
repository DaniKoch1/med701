In August 2022 the EU commission published Annex1, a set of guidelines and rules for the manufacturing of sterile medicinal products within EU countries. This project aims to help entry-level employees in the least critical clean rooms to enhance their knowledge about the new regulations learned through reading them. To do so, a Virtual Reality application utilizing gamification and adaptability was developed. This is the source code of the developed prototype.

This project uses assets from the _Chemistry Lab Items Pack_ from the Unity Asset store:
